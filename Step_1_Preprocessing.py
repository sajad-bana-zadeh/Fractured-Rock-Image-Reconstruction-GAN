'''
Step 1: Preprocessing - Extracting the Square from the Circular Image

This is the most critical initial step. We'll write a Python script using OpenCV to process a single image first, then extend it to process all images in your dataset.

Goal: Take an image like the one you showed, identify the circular rock region, crop it to a square that tightly encloses the circle, and then resize it to a standard dimension.

# --- How to test this function with your sample image ---
# 1. set your sample image (sample_image.png)
#    into the same directory as your Python script, "Fractured-Rock-Image-Reconstruction-GAN/data/sample_data/sample_image.png", or provide its full path.
# 2. Replace 'sample_image.png' with the actual file name.

# Example usage:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    sample_image_path = 'data/sample_data/sample_image.png'
    processed_sample_img = preprocess_image(sample_image_path, plot_steps=True)

    if processed_sample_img is not None:
