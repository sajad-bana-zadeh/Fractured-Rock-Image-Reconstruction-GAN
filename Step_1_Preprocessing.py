'''
Step 1: Preprocessing - Extracting the Square from the Circular Image

This is the most critical initial step. We'll write a Python script using OpenCV to process a single image first, then extend it to process all images in your dataset.

Goal: Take an image like the one you showed, identify the circular rock region, crop it to a square that tightly encloses the circle, and then resize it to a standard dimension.

    Loads an image, robustly identifies the main circular rock region,
    then crops the LARGEST INSCRIBED SQUARE from WITHIN that circle,
    and resizes it. This version aims to remove all black borders and
    circular outlines, yielding only the internal rock structure.

    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the input image.
        output_size (tuple): Desired (width, height) for the output square image.
