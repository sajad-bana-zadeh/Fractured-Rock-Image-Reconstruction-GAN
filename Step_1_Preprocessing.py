Step 1: Preprocessing - Extracting the Square from the Circular Image

This is the most critical initial step. We'll write a Python script using OpenCV to process a single image first, then extend it to process all images in your dataset.

Goal: Take an image like the one you showed, identify the circular rock region, crop it to a square that tightly encloses the circle, and then resize it to a standard dimension.
