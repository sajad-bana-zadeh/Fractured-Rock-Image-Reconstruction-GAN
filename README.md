# Fractured-Rock-Image-Reconstruction-GAN
This project utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to reconstruct fractured oil reservoir rock images from micro-CT scans. It learns fracture morphologies from a dataset of gray and binary images, enabling the generation of realistic cracks in crack-free rock matrix images.
